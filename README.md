## Mod2 Static Comp##

### Overview ###
This static comp challenge is a challenge to get us working that HTML/CSS muscle. We were asked to recreate a webpage based off of the provided static comp below. We were given a bit of creative license, however the objective was to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. This is to help us with building out comps that reflect the designerâ€™s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail as a requirement.
